== Using Spring Modulith

Spring Modulith consists of a set of libraries that can be used individually and depending on which features of it you would like to use.
To ease the declaration of the individual modules, we recommend to declare the following BOM in your Maven POM:

.Using the Spring Modulith  BOM
[source, xml, subs="+attributes"]

<dependencyManagement>
  <dependencies>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.springframework.modulith</groupId>
      <artifactId>spring-modulith-bom</artifactId>
      <version>{projectVersion}</version>
      <scope>import</scope>
      <type>pom</type>
    </dependency>
  </dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>

The individual sections describing Spring Modulith features will refer to the individual artifacts that are needed to make use of the feature.
For an overview about all modules available, have a look at xref:appendix.adoc#appendix.artifacts[Spring Modulith modules].
